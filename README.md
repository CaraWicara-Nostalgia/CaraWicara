# Project Background
Speaking ability is **vital for effective communication in human life**. Children with Down syndrome often face challenges in language development, experiencing physical and mental retardation. Globally, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 babies are born with Down syndrome annually, with around 8 million affected individuals worldwide. In Indonesia, about 0.41 percent of children aged 24-29 months have disabilities since birth, with 0.21 percent having Down syndrome. These children encounter **difficulties in speaking and language due to limitations in language development**. Speech and language issues affect five to eight percent of preschool-aged children. While initial language development is similar between normal babies and those with Down syndrome, differences in interaction patterns become noticeable by age two. 

Children with Down syndrome tend to focus more on interpersonal interactions, reflecting delays in their language development. Their vocabulary development aligns with their mental age, with most forming meaningful two-word expressions by age six. Intervention services are crucial for children at risk of developmental obstacles, encompassing motor skills, communication, and language.
